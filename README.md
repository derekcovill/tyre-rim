# tyre-rim
This repo provides a machine learning model to predict the energy transmitted to a cyclists hands. This repository was developed by Derek Covill from the Univeristy of Brighton (d.covill@brighton.ac.uk, https://research.brighton.ac.uk/en/persons/derek-covill) and is part of a longstanding research project with Professor Jean-Marc Drouet from the Universit√© de Sherbrooke (https://velus.recherche.usherbrooke.ca/). 

The repo includes both the original dataset (tyre-rim.csv) and a cutdown version of this which includes only the three key features (Tyre Pressure, Tyre Size, Rim Size) (tyre-rim-3var.csv). It also includes a comprehensive Jupyter notebook with all pre-processing steps, models and analysis code. A number of regression models are run in the Jupyter notebook, including Random Forest, Gradient Boosting Regressor and Support Vector Machine. These are run independently stacked also. The notebook also includes further code with relevant calculations and chart plotting.
